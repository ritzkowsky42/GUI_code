# GUI for D-scan spectra aquisition 

The code in this repo is used to create a graphical user interface for D-scan spectrum measurements. 

As of 12/9/24, the GUI has been tested only for a dummy case where the spectrpometer and sources are simulated. 
#### Running updates
[12/10/24] Wedge insertion depth now is a user input instead of being hard coded.
